# LaTeX Resources

[The Latex Cheat Sheet](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/beber/files/Chang_LaTeX_sheet.pdf) LaTeX has a lot of novel conventions that I fnd nearly impossible to memorize. They're useful, and LaTeX is a pretty essential tool, so I always keep this reference handy.

[Latex Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki) The best and most robust Latex extension for Visual Studio Code. Like Latex itself, I often forget useful features of the extension, so I keep the wiki open whenever I'm building a Latex document.
